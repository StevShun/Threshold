# threshold

## What is it?
The goal of this application is to display all running applications that have
made network connections. In addition, it can submit the application to
[VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/) for a quick "known / unknown"
analysis.

## How the heck do I use this thing?
Development of threshold is ongoing. It is a personal project that I use to
explore programming practices (sometimes, not the best). I hope to have
something usable soon (tm).

## What are some project goals?
I am glad you asked :)

I have a few in mind:

| Goal                                                        | Status |
|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| Implement an event bus                                      | Done   |
| Determine which applications are making network connections | Done   |
| Get the path, name, PID, and connection of an application   | Done   |
| Get a "hash report" of an application using VirusTotal      | Done   |
| Provide a UI to display app / connection info to the user   | TBD    |
